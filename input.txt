The food is very good
This is worst food ever
The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again
This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.
Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.
Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon!
I am a bit disappointed.  The flavor was not what I wanted or expected.
It's not real crispy, sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls.
This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater.
most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
